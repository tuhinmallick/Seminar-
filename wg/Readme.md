1. Did you all know each other originally?
2. How long have you been living ?
3. How do you spend your weekends ?
4. Do you all cook together?
5. Do you all sit together and watch TV?

Hi, I am Tuhin. I have just started my Master in  Winter Semester 2020. I have also got two HIWI jobs at the University ( at Machine learning and Data Analytics lab and FAPS as a Research Assistant ). As a result, the location is perfect for me.

I like spending my spare time with my friends, a good thriller film or go for a bike ride in Meilwaald . I am always up for a barbecue evening or a glass of wine on the couch with action movies. Since it's near Bohlenplatz, that would be a bonus for me as I mostly spend my time there either playing or teaching Table tennis. You wrote in the advertisement that you are looking for more than just someone to help pay the rent, so we can do some things together once in a while, right? Nothing stands in the way of a collective binge watching and film evenings  :-) 

After a trip to Pottenstein, I saw many people climbing and I wanted to start doing it too so I started practicing Bouldering near a place in Franconian International School.

Due to Covid and online lectures, it was pretty hard to know people as I was pretty new. But as Summer came and things started getting normal, I started playing table tennis at the parks but mostly at Bohlenplatz. There I got introduced to new people and soon, I had a bunch of German friends with whom I started to hang out and they introduced me to this wonderful game of BEER PONG. And soon, the frequency increased and I think I am getting pretty good at it. Oh I forgot about Spikeball. It's pretty cool too. 

Do you guys cook together ?

I randomly met some people at the Biergardens and since we vibed, we thought of making something like a International drinks nights, where people mostly bought things who were popular in their country. 


Do you guys travel together ?

As far as time and money permit, I am crazy about travelling and would love to travel around once this pandemic settles or I get my second vaccine dose


Recently, I have joined Spvgg Erlangen and would be representing them in Table tennis in the liga.
