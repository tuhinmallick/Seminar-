# Weakly supervised learning for Digital Pathology 


Goal of talk (example): Introduce the concept of weakly supervised learning (in contrast to fully supervised learning) – what are the benefits and challenges? Showcase one or more examples for weakly supervised learning in Digital Pathology. • Campanella et al.: Clinical-grade computational pathology using weakly supervised deep learning on whole slide images • Xu et al.: Weakly supervised histopathology cancer image segmentation and classification, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841514000188
